## Intro to Makefiles

```bash
g++ main.cpp file1.cpp file2.cpp -o main
```

Why this sucks:
* Long, prone to errors
* Not very customizable

Solution: makefile!

```bash
make
```

#### Structure of a Makefile

```makefile
all: data.o io.o main.o
    gcc data.o io.o main.o -o myexecutable
data.o: data.c data.h
    gcc -c data.c
io.o: io.c io.h
    gcc -c io.c
main.o: main.c data.h io.h common.h
    gcc -c main.c
clean:
    rm *.o myexecutable
```

Each line has a *target*, *dependencies*, and an *action* or *command*.
* **Target**: The first word before the colon. When `make` is called, the make build `all` is ran. You can type `make data.o` instead to run the process for `data.o`.
* **Dependencies**: The filenames after the colon, which are the files the command operates on and their dependencies.
* **Command**: A command or list of bash commands that are run on the dependency files.

#### Macros in Makefile

This is what macros look like (note that there is no checking of validity until the commands are run):

```makefile
OBJECTS = hello.o classname.o
CPPFLAGS = -c -Wall -Wextra -Wvla -pedantic -O3
```

#### Object files
* Pre-compiled â€“ much faster to complie compared to executables
* If you change one part, you only need to recompile that one part from source.
 
#### GDB

* Text-based debugging tool
* Useful for solving segfaults (program received signal SIGSEGV), or memory issues, e.g., index out of bounces
* When compiling, add -g to Makefile
* adds debugging symbols to binary
 
To start, type `gdb <exe_name>`.

#### Commands

* **(r)un**: start executable
* **(b)reak**: sets breakpoints
* **where**: prints function line where seg. fault occurred
* **(b)ack(t)race**: prints the full chain fo function calls
* **(s)tep**: executes current line of the program, enters function calls
* **(n)ext**: like step but does not enter functions
* **(c)ontinue**: continue to the next breakpoint
* **(p)rint *var***: prints the value of *var*
* **watch *var***: watch a certain variable
* **(l)ist *line_num*** : list source code near line_num
* **kill**: terminate the executable
* **quit**: quit GDB
 
## Unit Testing

* Used for testing a program
* Unit tests because small test in your program that make sure that your decomposable parts are working
* Include `<assert>` library
* `assert` that something is true, and if it is not true then the code triggers a breakpoint.

#### Example

```c++
class PowerRaiser {
public:
    PowerRaiser( unsigned int _base) : base(_base) {}
    unsigned int getBase() {
    return base};
}

class PowerRaiserTest{
public:
    runTestGetBase() {
        PowerRaiser p(10);
        assert(p.getBase() == 10);
    }
    
    runTestRaise() {
        PowerRaiser p(3);
        assert(1 == p.raise(0));
        assert(3 == p.raise(1));
    }
    
    testAll() {
        testGetBase();
        testGetPower();
    }
```
