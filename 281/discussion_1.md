## Intro to Makefiles

```bash
g++ main.cpp file1.cpp file2.cpp -o main
```

Why this sucks:
* Long, prone to errors
* Not very customizable

Solution: makefile!

```bash
make
```

#### Structure of a Makefile

```makefile
all: data.o io.o main.o
    gcc data.o io.o main.o -o myexecutable
data.o: data.c data.h
    gcc -c data.c
io.o: io.c io.h
    gcc -c io.c
main.o: main.c data.h io.h common.h
    gcc -c main.c
clean:
    rm *.o myexecutable
```

Each line has a *target*, *dependencies*, and an *action* or *command*.
* **Target**: The first word before the colon. When `make` is called, the make build `all` is ran. You can type `make data.o` instead to run the process for `data.o`.
* **Dependencies**: The filenames after the colon, which are the files the command operates on and their dependencies.
* **Command**: A command or list of bash commands that are run on the dependency files.

#### Macros in Makefile

This is what macros look like (note that there is no checking of validity until the commands are run):

```makefile
OBJECTS = hello.o classname.o
CPPFLAGS = -c -Wall -Wextra -Wvla -pedantic -O3
```

#### Object files
* Pre-compiled – much faster to complie compared to executables
* If you change one part, you only need to recompile that one part from source.
 
#### GDB

* Text-based debugging tool
* Useful for solving segfaults (program received signal SIGSEGV), or memory issues, e.g., index out of bounces
* When compiling, add -g to Makefile
* adds debugging symbols to binary
 
To start, type `gdb <exe_name>`.

#### Commands

* (r)un: start executable
* (b)reak: sets breakpoints
* where: prints function line where seg. fault occurred
* (b)ack(t)race: prints the full chain fo function calls
* (s)tep: executes current line of the program, enters function calls
* (n)ext: like step but does not enter functions
* (c)ontinue: contineu to the next breakpoint
* (p)rint <var>: prints the value of <var>
* watch <var>: watch a certain variable
* (l)ist line num : list source cdoce near line num
* kill: terminate the executable
* quit: quit GDB
