# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Purpose

This Gitbook was originally meant to be a collection of all my notes from [EECS 281](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs281/), the data structures and algorithms course at the University of Michigan. 

However, I am not limiting the content of this book to the course material alone. Rather, this book is meant to facilitate understanding of data structures in algorithms.

## Sources of information
* **Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition** by Cormen *et al*. (CLRS).
* EECS 281 lecture notes

Other sources will be added as they are used.

## Structure

The structure of book will roughly follow that of the Introduction to Algorithms textbook. Each section will consist of notes, and implementations of algorithms in Python, preferably, and C++ if needed.
